🗳 Voting System Project Using Python (While Loop)

This project is a simple command-line Voting System built using Python. It allows users to cast votes for three candidates:

- 🧑‍💼 Dileep  
- 👨‍💼 Manoj  
- 👨‍💼 Parkash

🔁 While Loop Functionality:  
The program runs inside a while loop, continuously prompting users to vote until they choose to exit. Each vote updates the respective candidate's vote count.

✅ Key Features:
- Cast multiple votes using loop  
- Track individual vote counts  
- Prevent invalid input  
- Final result displayed with winner announcement 🎉

🏆 Final Result Announcement:  
After exiting the loop, the program compares the total votes and announces the winner with the highest number of votes. In case of a tie, it declares the result as "Election tied."

📌 Purpose:  
A beginner-friendly project to understand loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
